# Busbar

> A fast, native-protocol LLM gateway with weighted pool composition and correct
> billing-vs-client failure handling.

Busbar sits in front of multiple LLM providers and routes each request to a model
or a **pool** of models, with per-member health tracking via a circuit breaker. It
speaks each provider's **native protocol** where it can and only translates when a
request crosses protocols — so homogeneous calls pass through losslessly
(preserving `cache_control`, thinking blocks, citations, native usage accounting).

The name comes from electrical distribution: a busbar takes one feed and fans it
out across many breakered circuits — one entry point, weighted distribution,
per-circuit protection.

> **Project status: early / pre-1.0, in active development.** The shipping path
> today is an Anthropic-format gateway with named/ad-hoc routing, round-robin
> pools, and a circuit breaker. Weighted distribution, OpenAI ingress, and
> cross-protocol failover are in progress. APIs and config may change before 1.0.
> See [`docs/`](docs/) for the design and roadmap.

## Why Busbar

- **Native protocols first.** No mandatory OpenAI-shaped lingua franca; translation
  is confined to cross-protocol hops, so provider-specific features survive.
- **Correct failure semantics.** A backend is ejected for *upstream* faults (5xx,
  overload, rate-limit, billing/quota) but never for *client-supplied* 4xx (a
  malformed or oversized request). A healthy backend is never penalized because a
  caller sent garbage.
- **Single static binary.** Deploy-and-done, no runtime, no GC pauses.

## Quick start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Configure: providers.yaml (shipped defs) + config.yaml (deployment with keys)
export ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-...
export ZAI_KEY=...

# Run (BUSBAR_PROVIDERS defaults to /etc/busbar/providers.yaml, BUSBAR_CONFIG to /etc/busbar/config.yaml)
BUSBAR_PROVIDERS=./providers.yaml BUSBAR_CONFIG=./config.yaml ./target/release/busbar
```

The two-file model separates vetted provider knowledge (`providers.yaml`) from operator deployment config (`config.yaml`). Operators reference providers by NAME in `config.yaml` and supply their keys via env vars.

## API

Clients append `/v1/messages` themselves, matching the Anthropic SDK.

| Method · Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /<name>/v1/messages` | `<name>` is a model (`/glm-4.6`) **or** a pool (`/glm`) |
| `POST /<provider>/<model>/v1/messages` | ad-hoc direct route (`/z.ai/glm-4.6`) |
| `GET /stats` | per-member health, counts, and pool membership (JSON) |
| `GET /healthz` | `200` if any member is usable, else `503` |

The router rewrites the request's `model` field and injects the provider's
credential — the caller's own model/key fields are ignored.

## Configuration

Busbar uses a two-file model:

- **`providers.yaml`** (shipped): contains vetted provider definitions with protocol, base_url, and error_map. Operators rarely modify this file.
- **`config.yaml`** (deployment): operator-owned config that references providers by NAME from `providers.yaml` and supplies their keys via `api_key_env`.

Providers declare a `base_url` and the **env var name** holding their key in `providers.yaml`. Models declare a `provider` and `max_concurrent`; pools are named lists of models whose concurrency caps stack into one aggregate. Keys are never stored in config files—only env var names.
