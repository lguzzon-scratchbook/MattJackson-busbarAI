# Busbar

**The reliability layer for LLM traffic.** One endpoint speaks every major SDK; fault-aware circuit breaking and in-flight failover keep your app serving when your providers aren't.

Busbar sits between your application and your LLM providers. Point any SDK — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Cohere — at one URL, and it routes, translates, and **keeps serving through provider failures**. It's a different class of tool than a proxy with a long model list.

> **You define a model name and its backends. Busbar accepts _any_ input protocol — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Cohere, Responses — and routes and translates accordingly.** One model name, reachable by every client; you choose what runs behind it.

- **Speaks every protocol losslessly, both ways** — not flattened to OpenAI shape, so Anthropic thinking blocks, Gemini safety settings, and Bedrock tool use survive the hop. Use whatever SDK your code already speaks, reach every model, swap providers with a config edit.
- **Fails over inside the request** — before your client sees a byte, even mid-stream, across protocol families. Not a 500 your user feels, not a 3am page.
- **A circuit breaker on every provider connection** — classifies each error (provider outage, your bad request, context-length, hard auth/billing failure) and treats each differently instead of retrying into a wall.

A single static Rust binary — no Python sidecar, no interpreter, no GC in the request path. Linux, macOS, Windows (Intel and ARM). Your keys, your network, your data path.

> **Status: 1.0.0-rc.4** — feature-complete, API-stable, hardened across a multi-round security and correctness audit. AGPL-3.0.

## The one-line change

Your code already speaks OpenAI (or Anthropic, or Gemini). Swap the base URL:

```diff
- client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)
+ client = OpenAI(api_key=BUSBAR_TOKEN, base_url="http://busbar:8080")

  # `model` now names a single model OR a pool you define in config
  # (e.g. "fast" = 80% Claude / 20% GPT-4o, Gemini on failover)
  client.chat.completions.create(model="fast", messages=[...])
```

That request left as OpenAI, may have been served by Anthropic, and came back as OpenAI — translated losslessly both ways. If Anthropic returned a 429 mid-flight, Busbar rerouted to the next pool member before your client saw a single byte. **The model name is a config value, not a code dependency.**

## A different class of product

| | Busbar | Self-hosted proxy | Hosted router |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cross-protocol translation** | Native, lossless both ways | Normalized to OpenAI shape | OpenAI shape only |
| **Circuit breaking** | Per provider connection, fault-attributed | Basic retry / cooldown | Not exposed |
| **Failover** | Mid-request, streaming-safe, across protocols | Exception-level retry | None |
| **Governance** | Virtual keys, budgets, ACLs | Add-on | Dashboard |
| **Keys & prompts** | Stay in your network | Stay in your network | Transit a third party |
| **Runtime** | Single static binary | Python + dependencies | n/a (hosted) |

Same arena as **LiteLLM** / **OpenRouter** — the difference is that Busbar is built reliability-first, and self-hosted is how it ships. → **[Why Busbar](https://ai-bus.bar/why-busbar/)**

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ai-bus.bar/install.sh | sh        # busbar + providers.yaml into ./
```

A minimal `config.yaml` (keys come from env vars, named here — never written into config):

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic: { api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_KEY }          # the NAME of the env var, not the key
models:
  claude: { provider: anthropic, max_concurrent: 10 }
pools:
  fast: { members: [ { target: claude, weight: 1 } ] }
```

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-...
BUSBAR_PROVIDERS=./providers.yaml BUSBAR_CONFIG=./config.yaml ./busbar
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"fast","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

## What's inside

- **Six wire protocols**, lossless both ways — any client protocol reaches any pool → [Protocols](https://ai-bus.bar/protocols/)
- **Fault-attributed circuit breaking** + **streaming-safe in-flight failover** → [Reliability](https://ai-bus.bar/reliability/)
- **Weighted pools** — smooth weighted round-robin, session affinity, per-lane concurrency → [Reliability](https://ai-bus.bar/reliability/)
- **Governance** — virtual keys, budgets, RPM/TPM limits, spend tracking → [Governance](https://ai-bus.bar/guides/governance/)
- **Vetted provider catalog** — plus any provider on the six protocols in a few lines of YAML → [Providers](https://ai-bus.bar/providers/)
- **Security-hardened** — SSRF guards, constant-time auth, SHA-256 key storage, secrets never logged → [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- **Observability** — Prometheus `/metrics`, OTLP traces, per-request webhook → [Configuration](https://ai-bus.bar/configuration/)
