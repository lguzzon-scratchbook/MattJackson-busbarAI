//! Active health probing.
//!
//! busbar's breaker is fundamentally *passive*: it trips on real request failures and recovers via
//! the half-open probe on the next organic request. Active probing layers a background prober on
//! top, per the provider's `health:` config:
//!
//! - `none` — no probing (the default; pure passive health).
//! - `dead` — re-probe ONLY tripped lanes, so a recovered upstream is picked back up promptly
//!   instead of waiting for organic traffic to drive the half-open probe.
//! - `active` — probe EVERY lane, so a silently-dead upstream trips out before real traffic hits.
//!
//! A probe is a one-token request built by the lane's protocol writer (`probe_body`), sent with the
//! lane's own auth/path. A 2xx recovers a tripped lane (→ Closed); any failure is recorded as a
//! transient (which, on a Closed lane in `active` mode, can trip it out).
